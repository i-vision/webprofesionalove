This plugin will add the script for Google Analytics (GA) in the <head> part of
your Question 2 Answer installation.

The only configurable part is in the "Plugins" section on the Admin interface.
To start using GA, just paste your UA id you get from Google. There's also 
possibility to disable tracking of Super Administrator's activities on the site.
